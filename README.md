# Java3311IntroToJava-without-OO-concepts-in-place-practice-UnoptimizedCode
Here is my code I've written for class assignments. Most of it is quickly written and not optimized or designed for error handling. I will be using this code to practice optimizing code, writing code to handle errors, and use object Oriented concpets to improve the usability of the code. 3311 was intro to Java for me at UTD.  

some of the code included is directly copied in class from the professor per note taking: Priya Narayanasami, some is directly taken from the book of: ITSS 3311: Introduction to Programming
zyBook ISBN: 978-1-5418-8782-4 but a majority of it is directly mine. 

It wasn't in my plans to share my code when I started the classes. However, I want to share work and then show improvements to show my progesss as a developer.
